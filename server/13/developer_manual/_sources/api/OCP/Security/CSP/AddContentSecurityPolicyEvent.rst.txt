=============================


.. php:namespace:: OCP\Security\CSP

.. php:class:: AddContentSecurityPolicyEvent


	.. rst-class:: phpdoc-description
	
		| Allows to inject something into the default content policy\. This is for
		| example useful when you\'re injecting Javascript code into a view belonging
		| to another controller and cannot modify its Content\-Security\-Policy itself\.
		
		| Note that the adjustment is only applied to applications that use AppFramework
		| controllers\.
		| 
		| WARNING: Using this API incorrectly may make the instance more insecure\.
		| Do think twice before adding whitelisting resources\. Please do also note
		| that it is not possible to use the \`disallowXYZ\` functions\.
