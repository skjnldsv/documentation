===========


.. php:namespace:: OCP

.. php:interface:: ITagManager


	.. rst-class:: phpdoc-description
	
		| Factory class creating instances of \\OCP\\ITags
		
		| A tag can be e\.g\. \'Family\', \'Work\', \'Chore\', \'Special Occation\' or
		| anything else that is either parsed from a vobject or that the user chooses
		| to add\.
		| Tag names are not case\-sensitive, but will be saved with the case they
		| are entered in\. If a user already has a tag \'family\' for a type, and
		| tries to add a tag named \'Family\' it will be silently ignored\.
