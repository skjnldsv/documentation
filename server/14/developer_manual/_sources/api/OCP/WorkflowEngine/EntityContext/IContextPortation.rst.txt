IContextPortation
=================


.. php:namespace:: OCP\WorkflowEngine\EntityContext

.. php:interface:: IContextPortation


	.. rst-class:: phpdoc-description
	
		| Interface IContextPortation
		
		| Occasionally an IEntity needs to be reused not in the same, but a new
		| request\. As IEntities receive custom context information during a flow
		| cycle, sometimes it might be necessary to export context identifiers to
		| be able to recreate the state at a later point\. For example: handling
		| translations in a notification INotifier\.
