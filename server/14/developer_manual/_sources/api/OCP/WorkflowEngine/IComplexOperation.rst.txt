		| Interface IComplexOperation
		
		| This interface represents an operator that is less generic and indicates
		| that some of the tasks it does itself instead of relying on the engine\.
		| This includes:
		| 
		| \* registering listeners â€“ the implementing app needs to ensure that the
		|   business logic registers listeners to the events it listens to\. For example
		|   when direct storage access is required, adding a wrapper or listening to
		|   a specific one is required over usual file events\.
