		| Interface ISpecificOperation
		
		| This interface represents an operator that is designed to work with exactly
		| one entity type\.
		| 
		| In almost all of the cases it is not necessary to have this limitation,
		| because the action is not connected to the event\. This mechanism suits
		| special cases\.
