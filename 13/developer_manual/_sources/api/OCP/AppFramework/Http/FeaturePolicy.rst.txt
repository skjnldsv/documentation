FeaturePolicy
=============


.. php:namespace:: OCP\AppFramework\Http

.. php:class:: FeaturePolicy


	.. rst-class:: phpdoc-description
	
		| Class FeaturePolicy is a simple helper which allows applications to
		| modify the Feature\-Policy sent by Nextcloud\. Per default only autoplay is allowed
		| from the same domain and full screen as well from the same domain\.
		
		| Even if a value gets modified above defaults will still get appended\. Please
		| notice that Nextcloud ships already with sensible defaults and those policies
		| should require no modification at all for most use\-cases\.
