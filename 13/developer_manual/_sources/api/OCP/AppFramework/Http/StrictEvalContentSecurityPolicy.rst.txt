StrictEvalContentSecurityPolicy
===============================


.. php:namespace:: OCP\AppFramework\Http

.. php:class:: StrictEvalContentSecurityPolicy


	.. rst-class:: phpdoc-description
	
		| Class StrictInlineContentSecurityPolicy is a simple helper which allows applications to
		| modify the Content\-Security\-Policy sent by Nextcloud\. Per default only JavaScript,
		| stylesheets, images, fonts, media and connections from the same domain
		| \(\'self\'\) are allowed\.
		
		| Even if a value gets modified above defaults will still get appended\. Please
		| notice that Nextcloud ships already with sensible defaults and those policies
		| should require no modification at all for most use\-cases\.
		| 
		| This is a temp helper class from the default ContentSecurityPolicy to allow slow
		| migration to a stricter CSP\. This does not allow unsafe eval\.
